Head First Design Pattern example implemenation on Actionscript 3.0
================================================

Observer Pattern
------------------------------------------------
The Observer Pattern defines one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one Object changes the state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.



Decorator Pattern
------------------------------------------------
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
